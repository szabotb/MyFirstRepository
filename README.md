# MyFirstRepository

This repository is my first Git repository. I use it to practice Git and to keep my first testing project in a professional way.

My testing project is an output of what I'm currently learning, and that is test automation. I currently participate in Flow Academy-s Test Automation Engineer course and we do close-to-real-life projects to learn how test automation works. 

Learning Git is not a part of the course, I study it by myself, but we learn many other usefull skills such as:

    - Javascript
    - Gherkin syntax
    - Taiko
    - Gauge
    - Jira
    - HTML + CSS (very basic level)

This repository contains not only the files of my testing project, but also my Javascript files which I made for practicing Javascript.
